	</a>

	<p class="section-title">Concept</p>
	<p class="section">That is the first automaton I made! I needed an action with a very simple movement to start out and my dad had this idea which worked really well. The drinking motion could be done by a simple crank-and-lever mechanism and the robot only needed to be articulated at one shoulder. I also spend some time trying out different variations for the bot's appearance (mainly on paper) and ended up with the design that I kept for all the others.</p>

	<p class="section-title">Construction</p>
	<p class="section">I already had all the tools and techniques I needed from previous projects so the fabrication was more a matter of learning how I should cut and fold the metal pieces to get a nice fit for most of them. You can see some of it was still a bit messy like the bot's hips which are pretty crumpled up. I also took the opportunity to try out several things for decoration to get a more steam-punk feel to the final result.</p>
	
	<p class="section-title">New things</p>
	<p class="section">Well at this point almost everything was new, but I can summarize the main things I learned:
	  <ul>
	    <li>General shape of the body pieces and head.</li>
	    <li>Spring-like arms and legs.</li>
	    <li>Minimalist wire-based mechanism.</li>
	    <li>Mechanism embedded on a bottom plate with a random shape (anything but a rectangle).</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p class="section-title">What needs improvement</p>
	<p class="section">When I was done with this I was pleasantly surprised because it was functional and didn't look too bad but I also really needed to improve several things. The main issues were:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Durability: all the parts were just super-glued together without any thought to robustness (and several parts actually broke later when transporting it).</li>
	    <li>Pieces should fit more cleanly together: the body parts mainly gave me a feel of "it worked but I don't really know why" so I need a process that's more easily reproductible, which means having a more precise idea of the shape of the pieces in advance.</li>
	    <li>Less clunky decoration: most pieces here are not that eye-catching but I feel the seat is a bit confusing. To be honnest I wanted something I could easily adjust for the height so ended up making some sort of spring, but it makes it harder to discern the limit between the robot and the seat.</li>
	</ul></p>
