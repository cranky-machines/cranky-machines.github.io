	<p class="section-title">Concept</p>
	<p class="section">This robot was meant to be another simple concept, with almost no props, in order to get used to the making process. The movement is a bit interesting because the robot's swing has to be faster when it swats than when it raises its hand. I also decided to make the fly swatter because there was one at home and it seemed fun.</p>

	<p class="section-title">Construction</p>
	<p class="section">With the crouched position, it was more difficult to get the proportions right for the limbs. Even though the robots aren't supposed to be perfectly anatomically correct, the arms still look a bit too long on this one, especially the articulated one. I also had a bit of trouble with the mechanism because I hadn't anticipated that the crank axis would need to be pretty high.</p>
	
	<p class="section-title">New things</p>
	<p class="section">This bot wasn't too complicated and didn't take too long to make but there were some interesting differences with the first:
	  <ul>
	    <li>New mechanism that can offer a different dynamic and more jerky movement.</li>
	    <li>New shape for the head (more rounded, less pointy), which is easier to make and more resistant.</li>
	    <li>Articulated elbow, which requires to pass wires through the arms and make a smaller hinges.
	    <li>The telescopic fly swatter introduces a fun random element to the dynamic.</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p class="section-title">What needs improvement</p>
	<p class="section">For the most part, his showed me that I could keep making similar robots consistently enough. To summarize, here are the main improvements I'd make on it:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Limb proportions: I don't really measure anything precisely but I should try not to make the arms too long, especially when articulated.</li>
	    <li>This mechanism is a bit visually confusing because the "lever" fixed to the arms isn't always moving. This means it's harder to spot what's part of the robot and what's part of the mechanism.</li>
	    <li>The base-piece was a bit uneven and felt more fragile due to making it out of multiple pieces of metal.</li>
	</ul></p>

	  I didn't actually take any photos of this one before I gave it away, but I had a second video with a side-view of it.
