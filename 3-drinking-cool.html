	<p class="section-title">Concept</p>
	<p class="section">So maybe I got a bit lazy with the idea, but in a way this allowed me to redo a new version of the first bot and see how I could improve upon it. Also I gave it to someone who likes to party a lot so I tried to give it a different feel, less sad and more at ease.</p>

	<p class="section-title">Construction</p>
	<p class="section">Most of the process went pretty smoothly, as I'm already getting used to it and know what shapes I need for the metal pieces. That's why I ended up playing around more with the details. The small shot glasses and the bottle were good to try making small props. On a whim I also decided to make the base plate "fit in" with the sad robot one (making a sort of yin yang symbol with the tables).</p>
	
	<p class="section-title">New things</p>
	<p class="section">As I mentioned, most of the new stuff here came from the details and props:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Sunglasses can be taken off (fixed to the eyes).</li>
	    <li>Smaller props are fun to make and make for good decoration.</li>
	    <li>Base-plates that fit together could be a nice way to make more complex mechanisms in several parts (like being able to use one crank for two robots that are "linked" together). It didn't prove that useful in this case though.</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p class="section-title">What needs improvement</p>
	<p class="section">This was already an improved version of the first bot so I fixed some of the previous mistakes I'd made, but I couldn't fix everything:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Durability: the robot is still fragile. Even though the pieces are attached a bit better (usually jammed into each other), this bot still broke later at the neck.</li>
	    <li>Make it more expressive: I somehow managed to make the first one clearly hunched over and depressed but this one's posture isn't that expressive. It seems laid back but not particularly happy or drunk.</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p class="section-title">Videos and more pictures</p>
	<p class="section">
	  I don't have any pictures of this one but there is a second video of the bot without sunglasses. The videos are still vertical because I didn't think I'd be posting those either.
