	<h2 class="title">Using wires to make the robots sturdier</h2>
	
	<p class="section-title">Wires in the robot's body</p>
	<p class="section">
	  The main point of putting wires in the bots' body is to join all of its different parts. This means the wires have to be fixed to the center of the torso and extend to all the different limbs. The head is usually particularly fragile so it should be attached very well (with some kind of a "knot"). To put all this together, the assembly has to be planned in advance, to attach all the pieces in the right order. Finally, when eveything is assembled, superglue still ensures that the joints aren't too wobbly.

	  Here are some of the drawings I made for planning the internal wires for the violinist and reader bots.

	<p class="section-title">Weaving wires in the props and bottom plate</p>
	<p class="section">
	  For putting larger pieces together, the wires have to bind the joints really tightly so that they don't budge at all. For that, it's best to pass a wire several times through the pieces you need to attach, a bit like sewing. Then the joint can be tightened by pulling on the wire and holding the ends in place.
	</p>
	<p class="section">
	  Here are some pictures that show how the props and robots from the reader bots were attached to the bottom plate. Every wire end was superglued to be sure that it stayed in placed after tightening it.
