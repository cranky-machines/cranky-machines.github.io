	<p class="section-title">Concept</p>
	<p class="section">I really wanted to try making a robot with a more fully articulated arm and this was the perfect opportunity! I got the idea from a friend who's often mixing on his turntable. This was also the occasion to start making larger and more complex props.</p>

	<p class="section-title">Construction</p>
	<p class="section">This one was pretty fun to make. This time, making the robot's body didn't take too long and the mechanism wasn't anything new, so I could focus on the turntables. I really liked the idea of embedding lots of speakers in the front for decoration but it was more complicated than I had anticipated. In the end I had to cut the table into lots of smaller pieces that I actually glued around the speakers, which was pretty messy.</p>
	
	<p class="section-title">New things</p>
	<p class="section">
	  <ul>
	    <li>Articulated arm at the shoulder AND elow.</li>
	    <li>Tried drawing some details by engraving the metal (like for the lines on the vinyls).</li>
	    <li>The chair is actually set on a spring which makes the robots kind of "dance" when you crank it. This wasn't intended but makes for a fun effect.</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p class="section-title">What needs improvement</p>
	<p class="section">
	  <ul>
	    <li>Process for embedding details in props: the process for making the turntable was more laborious than it had to be because I didn't plan it in advance that well.</li>
	    <li>Limbs still don't look right: this time the arms came out okay but the legs are really too short. Good thing they're hidden behind the table.</li>
	    <li>Engravings on the metal pieces are hard to discern: I tried to draw some buttons between the two vinyls but you can't really see them unless the lighting is just right.</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p class="section-title">Videos and more pictures</p>
	<p class="section">
	  Here are two videos of the robot. You can see the mechanism on the one with a 3/4ers view.
