	<p class="section-title">Concept</p>
	<p class="section">This robot seems simple compared to some of the other ones: no props, only one robot and one movement. However it was interesting to try reproducing a movement I didn't really understand. I don't play the violin so I had to look at some several videos to see plan the movement. It was a also the first time I made a robot with 3 hinges on one arm, which is much more complicated to control.</p>

	<p class="section-title">Construction</p>
	<p class="section">There was mostly no problem for most of the robot's body. Only the playing arm took a little more attention: I had to make very small hinges and also make them sturdy so that it wouldn't be too wobbly. The mechanism took a bit more tweaking. I couldn't really plan it completely in advance, but I knew I wanted the elbow and wrist to move up and down successively. Then I mounted the whole thing and just tweaked the timing until it was alright.</p>
	
	<p class="section-title">New things</p>
	<p class="section">
	  <ul>
	    <li>Arm articulated in 3 points: the different sections have to be controlled separately.</li>
	    <li>Wires to  make the assembly sturdier: the entire body is linking together with internal wires instead of just glue (I'll make a more detailed post about this part of the process). The feet are also connected to the bottom plate.</li>
	    <li>Detachable crank handle: to transport it more easily. It stays in place without any glue.</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p class="section-title">What needs improvement</p>
	<p class="section">
	  <ul>
	    <li>Hinges are too flimsy: it makes the movement a bit random. It kind of works in this context because it makes it look like the bot is playing different notes but it could be a problem for a more precise movement.</li>
	    <li>Not enough planning: I feel like things worked out a little by luck. I also had to make the lever for the wrist exensible because the mation was weird when the length was fixed... I still have to figure out how to plan these more complex movements in advance.</li>
	</ul></p>

	  Yeah, vertical format again, sorry about that.
